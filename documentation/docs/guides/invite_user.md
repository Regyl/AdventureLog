# Invite a User

AdventureLog allows for admin users to invite new users to create an account via an email invitation.
Invites are sent from the AdventureLog [Admin Panel](admin_panel.md) or via a custom invite form. The invite section of the admin panel can be found at `/admin/invitations/invitation/add/`.
